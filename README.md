# Todo List Project (per The Odin Project)

Live Demo Here: https://lindsaysofia.github.io/todo-list/

Created a Todo List with the following:
- Projects are listed on the left.
- Once you click on a project, it will show you the associated todos with that project.
- You can add new Projects/Todos by using the add button the bottom left-hand side.
- You can edit the project title.
- You can expand a todo to show additional details.
- You can toggle the due date to give an approximate date (i.e. "Due in 4 days") or an actual date (MM/DD/YYYY).
- You can mark projects and todos are complete or delete them, both of which will remove them from the current projects or todo lists.
- Projects and Todos are stored in local storage.

Overall this was a really fun project. I thought I had it all planned out when I first started, but there were so many things I didn't think about that I was forced to along the way. Basically I had only thought about the layout and what I wanted it to look like vs the actual implementation. I think for furture projects I will try to think more carefully about all aspects of it, not just the design. But it was great practice and I tried to incorporate more of what I've been learning structure-wise (using constructors, separating dom logic from application logic, Single Responsibility principle, loosely (not tightly) coupled objects, etc.)
